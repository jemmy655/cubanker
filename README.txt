Introduction
------------
Cubanker aims to provide an opensource banking platform for use by small banks, credit unions and community banks.
This project sets out to remove the cost of the banking system from the equation and provide a flexible yet reliable system for these small financial instiutions to run their banking operations.

Cubanker is not an accounting system but is intended to be operated in conjunction with an accounting system.
Cubanker is being written on Linux and is intended to be deployed on cloud hosted Linux servers.

Building t6he source
--------------------
Stupid DropBox! keeps saying debian and DEBIAN are case-conflicting.  Therefore please rename _debian_ to debian before trying to use the doagain.sh script or building the project some other way.
